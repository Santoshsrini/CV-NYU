This repo contains the code and projects of the Computer Vision course by Prof Edward Wong at NYU. 

Canny Edge Detection Project is the implementation of Canny's Edge Detector algorithm in Python, which involves four major steps, namely, 
Gaussian smoothing, gradient operation, non-maxima suppression, and thresholding. 

Human Detection Project performs human detection of a given input image by computing the HOG (Histograms of Oriented Gradients) feature from the input image and then classify the HOG feature vector into human or no-human by using a 3-nearest neighbor (NN) classifier.
