# **Human Detection Project using HOG Features and 3NN classifier:*


The objective of this project is to develop a program that can accurately detect the presence of humans in images using the HOG feature and a 3-NN classifier. The program will convert color images into grayscale, compute the horizontal and vertical gradients using Sobelâ€™s operator, and quantize the gradient angle into 9 bins. The resulting HOG feature vector will be classified as human or no-human using the histogram intersection and Hellinger distance metrics. The classification accuracy for each distance metric will be reported. The program will be implemented in Python.
