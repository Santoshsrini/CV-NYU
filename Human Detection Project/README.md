# **Human Detection Project using HOG Features and 3NN classifier:**

## **Overview**

The objective of this project is to develop a program that can accurately detect the presence of humans in images using the HOG feature and a 3-NN classifier. The program will convert color images into grayscale, compute the horizontal and vertical gradients using Sobelâ€™s operator, and quantize the gradient angle into 9 bins. The resulting HOG feature vector will be classified as human or no-human using the histogram intersection and Hellinger distance metrics. The classification accuracy for each distance metric will be reported. The program will be implemented in Python.

## **Dataset:**

The dataset consists of 10 human images and 10 non-human images which are inputs. Additionally, there 10 test images on which our algorithms and classifier would be tested on for accuracy. 

## **Methodology:**

The HOG feature vector for each of the input image - 10 human images and 10 non-human images are computed. The test image's HOG feature is compared with the input images' feature vector using distance measurement ( Histogram intersection and Hellinger distance ). The class of the 3 nearest neighbours is finally chosen and reported.

## **Results:**

The results for the test images classification as human or not a human is reported using the histogram intersection distance or hellinger distance computation.
